# SEM-assignment: Connect Four
## About the game
„Connect Four“ is a two-player board game, in which the players take turns dropping their stones into 
a seven-column, six-row vertically suspended grid, with each stone occupying the lowest available 
space within the chosen column.  
The objective of the game is to form a line of four of one’s own 
stones, either vertically, horizontally or diagonally. The first player to reach that goal wins the 
game. If the board gets filled up before either player can place four stones in a row, the game is a 
draw and over.
